## SOLID principles

SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles intended to guide the development of well-structured and maintainable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming and software design. Here's a brief explanation of each principle:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or purpose. This helps in keeping the code focused, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering existing code, promoting reusability and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
This principle emphasizes that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be substitutable for its base class without causing unexpected behavior.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
The ISP suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. It promotes the idea of smaller, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones, reducing the coupling between classes and improving code maintainability.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to decouple components and improve flexibility.

By following the SOLID principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, extend, and maintain, leading to more robust and adaptable software systems.
